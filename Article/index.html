    <p align="justify">Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or
        an intranet (a
        private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to
        complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks
        to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development,
        client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce
        development.

        Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites:
        writing markup and coding.[2] Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes
        easier and available with basic technical skills.

        For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web
        developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites.[1] Smaller
        organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related
        job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may be a
        collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three
        kinds of Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer.[3]
        Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end
        developers deal with the servers.[4] Since the commercialization of the Web, the industry has boomed and has
        become one of the most used technologies ever.</p>

    <p>Frontend refers to the part of a software application or website that users interact with directly. It
        encompasses everything users see, touch, and experience, including the user interface, design, and
        functionality. Frontend development involves coding using technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to
        create a visually appealing and interactive experience for users. It's essentially what users see and interact
        with when they visit a website or use an application.</p>
    <p>The backend of a software application or website refers to the part that users don't see directly but that is
        responsible for the behind-the-scenes functionality, data processing, and logic. It consists of server-side code
        and databases that work together to process requests from the frontend, perform computations, retrieve and store
        data, and ultimately deliver the required information or functionality to the user's browser or device.

        Backend development involves writing code in languages such as Python, Java, Ruby, or Node.js, and using
        frameworks like Django, Flask, Spring Boot, Ruby on Rails, or Express.js. It also involves working with
        databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or SQLite to store and manage data.</p>

    <P align="justify">HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be
        displayed in a web
        browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
        multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
        its appearance.

        HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
        interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents
        by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items.
        HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as < and directly introduce
            content into the page. Other tags such as and surround and provide information about document text and may
            include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the
            page. </P>
            <P align="justify">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the
                presentation and styling
                of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG,
                MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
                JavaScript.[2]

                CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and
                fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility;[further explanation needed] provide more
                flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages
                to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and
                repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load
                speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</P>
            <P align="justify">JavaScript is a programming language that enables interactive and dynamic features on web
                pages. It
                allows you to
                manipulate the HTML and CSS of a webpage, handle user interactions, perform calculations, validate
                forms, and
                much more.</P>

            <p align="justify">Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems
                in 1995. It has
                evolved
                from humble beginnings to power a large share of today’s digital world, by providing the reliable
                platform upon
                which many services and applications are built. New, innovative products and digital services designed
                for the
                future continue to rely on Java, as well.

                While most modern Java applications combine the Java runtime and application together, there are still
                many
                applications and even some websites that will not function unless you have a desktop Java installed.
                Java.com,
                this website, is intended for consumers who may still require Java for their desktop applications –
                specifically
                applications targeting Java 8. Developers as well as users that would like to learn Java programming
                should
                visit the dev.java website instead and business users should visit oracle.com/java for more information.

            <p align="justify">Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic
                semantics. Its
                high-level
                built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for
                Rapid
                Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing
                components
                together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of
                program
                maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse.
                The
                Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without
                charge for
                all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

                Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since
                there is no
                compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug
                or bad
                input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises
                an
                exception. When the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source
                level
                debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting
                breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python
                itself,
                testifying to Python's introspective power. On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program
                is to
                add a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very
                effective.</p>
            <p align="justify">PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a
                module, a daemon or a
                Common
                Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP
                code—which
                may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data—would form the whole or part of an
                HTTP
                response. Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist that
                can be
                employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for
                many
                programming tasks outside the web context, such as standalone graphical applications[15] and drone
                control.[16]
                PHP code can also be directly executed from the command line. </p>
            <p align="justify">The .NET Framework (pronounced as "dot net") is a proprietary software framework
                developed by Microsoft
                that runs
                primarily on Microsoft Windows. It was the predominant implementation of the Common Language
                Infrastructure
                (CLI) until being superseded by the cross-platform .NET project. It includes a large class library
                called
                Framework Class Library (FCL) and provides language interoperability (each language can use code written
                in
                other languages) across several programming languages. Programs written for .NET Framework execute in a
                software
                environment (in contrast to a hardware environment) named the Common Language Runtime (CLR). The CLR is
                an
                application virtual machine that provides services such as security, memory management, and exception
                handling.
                As such, computer code written using .NET Framework is called "managed code". FCL and CLR together
                constitute
                the .NET Framework.

                FCL provides the user interface, data access, database connectivity, cryptography, web application
                development,
                numeric algorithms, and network communications. Programmers produce software by combining their source
                code with
                .NET Framework and other libraries. The framework is intended to be used by most new applications
                created for
                the Windows platform. Microsoft also produces an integrated development environment for .NET software
                called
                Visual Studio. </p>
